# Pieces

The metadata catalog of automation integrations ("pieces") — each a named integration like `@activepieces/piece-gmail` providing actions and triggers. Stored in `piece_metadata` and served from an in-memory `pieceCache` rebuilt from the DB on startup and refreshed via pub/sub.

### Entities & services
- `piece_metadata` (PieceMetadataEntity) — unique on `(name, version, platformId)`; `platformId` null = official, set = custom piece for that platform. `actions`/`triggers` are JSON maps (each may carry an optional `outputSchema`).
- `pieceMetadataService` — `list` / `getOrThrow` / `listVersions` / `create` / `delete` / `registry`; owns cache interactions.
- `pieceInstallService.installPiece` — saves archive, dispatches an `EXECUTE_METADATA` engine job to extract metadata, then stores it.
- `pieceSyncService.sync` — upserts official pieces from the bundled registry file.
- Routes under `/v1/pieces`: list, `:name` get, `:name/versions`, `POST /options` (dynamic dropdown eval on a worker), `POST /` (platformAdmin — install custom piece), `POST /sync`, `DELETE /:id`.

### Types
- **PieceType** — `OFFICIAL` (bundled) or `CUSTOM` (platform-installed).
- **PackageType** — `REGISTRY` (NPM) or `ARCHIVE` (uploaded tarball; `archiveId` FKs to `file`).
- **OutputSchema** — optional per-action/trigger structured render hint (`fields`, `itemLabel`); set by the piece author, consumed by the builder's Smart Output Viewer and data selector. Opt-in and non-breaking.

### Gotchas
- Available all editions; base listing + install is Community-level.
- EE/Cloud per-piece and per-action/trigger visibility flows through `resolveVisibility` (`ee/pieces/filters/piece-filtering-utils.ts`), which returns a `VisibilityPolicy` or `null` on CE / when `platformId`/`projectId` is nil (callers treat `null` as no filtering). The policy is derived from the project's **piece set** (via `project.pieceSetId`, falling back to the platform Default).
- Install and sync also enqueue a tool-search reindex, but only when `isToolSearchEnabled()`; no-op otherwise.
- `delete` removes all versions sharing the name on that platform, and only for `CUSTOM` pieces the caller owns.
- **A piece silently vanishes from the list when its `minimumSupportedRelease` is ahead of the root `package.json` version.** `fetchLatestPieces` filters every piece through `isSupportedRelease(apVersionUtil.getCurrentRelease(), piece)`. Pieces are routinely merged targeting the *next* release, so on `main` a couple dozen are invisible locally until the version bump lands. No warning is logged — it just isn't there.
- **DynamicProperties clears its value before it knows the new schema, so the merge source must be a snapshot.** `DynamicPropertiesImplementation` re-fetches the child schema on every refresher change, clearing the form value synchronously and re-populating it in the mutation callback. The merge source for `getDefaultValueForProperties` has to be a `lastKnownValue` ref captured *before* the clear — reading `form.getValues()` in the callback sees the cleared `null` and defaults every child (GIT-1514). The snapshot must be spread-cloned: RHF `getValues(name)` hands back the live object and the clear's `setValue(...child, null)` mutates it in place. Guard the ref with `isNil` so it survives rapid successive changes, where later effect runs already observe `null`.
- `DynamicPropertiesContext` tracks loading by property name only, so two in-flight requests for the same property let the first completion clear the flag for both — briefly re-enabling Test Step while the value is still cleared.
- **The frontend `POST /v1/pieces/options` client only rejects for DYNAMIC.** `piecesApi.options` (`packages/web/src/features/pieces/api/`) catches DROPDOWN failures, toasts, and *resolves* with a disabled-dropdown fallback — so for dropdowns every error path wired onto that mutation is dead: `usePieceOptions`' `onError` handlers, its `retry: 1`, and the `if (error) throw error` into `DynamicPropertiesErrorBoundary`. DYNAMIC must rethrow: a swallowed failure arrives as a *successful* empty schema, which resets the property's children to defaults and gets persisted by step-settings autosave.
- **`AP_DEV_PIECES` shadows the DB registry copy by name**, so a dev piece failing the release gate removes the piece *entirely* rather than falling back to the published version. Dropping the name from `AP_DEV_PIECES` (or bumping the local root `package.json`) brings it back.
- **On an ARCHIVE install, the request's `pieceName`/`pieceVersion` are authoritative and are never checked against the tarball.** `extractPieceMetadata` (`packages/server/engine/src/lib/helper/piece-helper.ts`) loads the bundle, then returns `{...piece.metadata(), name: pieceName, version: pieceVersion}` from the request params. Verified live: the same 0.3.0 tarball declared as `pieceVersion=0.3.1` installs as 0.3.1, and declared under a different `pieceName` installs as a *separate* piece with the original `displayName` and actions. A typo in either field yields a wrong or duplicate piece with a **201**, not an error — and since `delete` removes every version sharing the name, a bad version cannot be removed without taking the good one with it. Installers must derive both fields from the artifact they ship.
- **The same version can only be installed once per platform, and there is no upsert.** A re-run returns `409` `{"code":"VALIDATION","params":{"message":"piece_metadata_already_exists name=… version=…"}}`. `pieceVersion` is `ExactVersionType` (`^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$`), so prerelease and range forms (`0.3.1-rc.1`, `~0.3.0`) are rejected with a `400`. Any missing or wrong-valued multipart field fails the `AddPieceRequestBody` union with an unspecific `400 "body/ Invalid input"` that does not name the field.
- **A 201 is synchronous end to end and waits on a worker**, because the app submits an `EXECUTE_EXTRACT_PIECE_INFORMATION` job and blocks on the reply — ~0.5 s for a 67 KB archive on an idle instance, and far worse with cold or busy workers, so client timeouts want to be generous. When it fails on a self-hosted install the usual cause is not the tarball but `AP_FRONTEND_URL` being unreachable *from inside the containers*: the app builds the bundle-download URL from its own `AP_FRONTEND_URL` (`piece-installer.ts` → `${publicApiUrl}v1/engine/pieces/bundle`) and hands it to the worker, so a host-only value surfaces as `ENGINE_OPERATION_FAILURE: fetch failed`.
